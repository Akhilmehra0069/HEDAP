# HEDAP

HEDAP, the Higher Education Data Architecture App, is released under the open source [BSD 3-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

Salesforce is designed for business organizations that operate based on opportunities, leads, and all the other sales-related concepts. HEDAP sits on top of Salesforce to make it Higher Ed-specific.

The biggest challenge to having a successful Salesforce Higher Ed ecosystem is that institutions are re-inventing the wheel, and creating those objects that need to be common to all in order for 3rd party apps to work across implementations. HEDAP is the foundational layer that is aimed to cover those areas common to the whole student lifecycle. 

HEDAP is built from the best practices used across the industry.
